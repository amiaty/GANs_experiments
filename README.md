# **GANs Experiments**
This code contains some basic GANs experiments with synthetics data and also MNIST dataset.  
The code written with pytorch framework.  

<br>  

#### **Requirements:**
* pytorch
* torchvision
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
  
<br>  

#### **Running the code:**
```
python 1d_gaussian.py
# or   
python mnist.py
```  
You can pass `1` (or any non-zero number) as cmd parameter to save experiment info and plot shots as training proceeds. also inside the code you can set `save_model` to save info and `save_figs` to save plot shots.
